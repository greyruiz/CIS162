                <p>And I'm having a lot of fun with it! Back around 2015-2016, I used to watch a streamer on twitch draw
                    her art comissions.
                    She played some of the prettiest music i had ever heard at the time. I guess most were from popular
                    korean drama's.
                    I'm not going to pretend I know a lot about music, but the melodies/harmonies/chord progressions
                    were so pleasing to my ears.
                    I Ended up going down a small journey of discovering some K-Pop and R&B. My taste in music hasn't
                    changed too much since then, but i
                    definitely have been listenting to more pop and western artists in general.</p>
                <p>However recently I dove back in to K-Pop per my friends reccomendation, and I'm having a blast. She's
                    Been asking me to check out a girl group
                    called 'Twice', and I finally did!
                </p>
                <h2>I... Am... A D D I C T E D</h2>
                <p>I am now in the shallow end of an insanely deep pool of music, and I'm so excited to check out more
                    artists! On top of that, I'm rediscovering
                    some old tracks I used to listen too back in the day (I get very sentimental about my music around
                    that time) and it just makes me smile
                    and reminisce.
                </p>

                <h2>Some Reccomendations</h2>
                <p>
                    I have weird tastes when it comes to music. I'll basically listen to anything, but it has to have
                    this certain sound. I grew up playing A LOT of video games. I know this is a strange comparison, but
                    the satisfaction I
                    get from a great video game OST and K-Pop is the same. While they differ in style, there's a certain
                    structure and musicality that really stands out to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's an interesting video from Genius Interviewing a group of producers on the making of one of my
                    favorite songs in K-Pop (Red Velvet's 'Bad Boy'. I highly recomend checking the song out):

                <p>If I had one song I would reccomend to the average western listener... it would be:</p>

                <p>Gallant has been one of 3 of my favorite artists for years now. This song was huge for me. It was my
                    second gateway drug into the K-Music Industry when i realized there was so much more to uncover.
                    Since it has a more western sound it's also easier to play around friends, lol.</p>

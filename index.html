        <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I'm Greg :) I've been taking classes on and off at cerritos until last fall
            when I decided to switch majors. I'm now taking things a little more seriously, and I'm
            working towards my aa for transfer in computer science. I never expected my education journey
            to be so prolonged, lol! However, I love to learn and I'm enjoying myself along this new
            path I am set on. I'm fascinated with this major and all it has to offer, and I'm really
            looking forward to this class :)</p>
        <h2>On My Free Time...</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm usually playing games on my PC or Switch</li>
            <li>I like to go out and eat/shop with my cousins :)</li>
            <li>I'll hyperfocus on a hobby, get reaaaaally into it, and then forget about it in a month
                (my most recent one being custom mechanical keyboards)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, I'd have to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"><strong>YouTube</strong></a>
            is my
            most used site.
            It not only provides so much free instructional content I apply
            to my studies, but also entertainment (my favorites being video essays
            on music, old shows/movies, and video games)</p>

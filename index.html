                <p>Hi there, I'm Greg :) I've been taking classes on and off at cerritos until last fall
                    when I decided to switch majors. I'm now taking things a little more seriously, and I'm
                    working towards my aa for transfer in computer science. I never expected my education journey
                    to be so prolonged, lol! However, I love to learn and I'm enjoying myself along this new
                    path I am set on. I'm fascinated with this major and all it has to offer, and I'm really
                    looking forward to this class :)</p>

                    <li>I'm usually playing games on my PC or Switch</li>
                    <li>I like to go out and eat/shop with my cousins :)</li>
                    <li>I'll hyperfocus on a hobby, get reaaaaally into it, and then forget about it in a month
                        (my most recent one being custom mechanical keyboards)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By default, I'd have to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"
                        target="_blank"><strong>YouTube</strong></a>
                    is my
                    most used site.
                    It not only provides so much free instructional content I apply
                    to my studies, but also entertainment (my favorites being video essays
                    on music, old shows/movies, and video games)</p>
